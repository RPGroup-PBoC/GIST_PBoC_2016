			<h1>Welcome!</h1>
			<hr />
			<p>This intensive several week mini-course explores the
			way that physical and mathematical models can be used
			to understand biological systems.  The course begins by
			examining the way in which simple order of magnitude
			estimates can be used to provide insights into problems
			ranging from the fidelity of protein translation to how
			far a bird can fly without stopping.  This is followed
			by the use of statistical mechanics to explore problems
			in regulatory biology.   Some examples include the
			physics of post-translational modifications, how cells
			make transcriptional decisions and the precision with
			which embryonic development takes place.   The next
			part of the course focuses on how organisms pack and
			access their genomes.  We start with a description of
			the problem of viral DNA packing and then turn to the
			study of the eukaryotic nucleosome. From there, we turn
			to the study of organization in biological systems with
			emphasis on one-dimensional ordering in the filamentous
			structures of the cytoskeleton to the two-dimensional
			ordering seen at the cell membrane.   In addition to
			these topics, the course also involves an intensive
			hands-on project using Matlab to do image segmentation
			in order to find the fluorescence of individual cells
			and to use this fluorescence to compare to statistical
			mechanical models of gene regulation.</p>
